## Problem Domain
Planning a project is an essential step to staying organized and increasing productivity through the working process. After running out of my own trello boards, I decided I wanted to create my own version of a kanban board that I can continue to personalize and use as I create my own personal projects. Creating this planning tool is to help others get to know their project, keep track of their progress, and use it with groups to make planning more inclusive. 

### MVP 
A planning tool app that allows users to use lists to keep track of work. Using this app, users will create a board, and from there users are provided a to-do column.  Users can build off of this by adding their own columns and then added tasks to the columns.  Users can modify each tasks by giving them a title, description, and checklist option. As the user progresses, the user can drag & drop tasks into different columns. Once the project is completed or the user no longer is working on the project - the user can delete the entire board if he/she does not want it to be saved.

#### Features
1. Create Kanban Boards
2. Create custom columns & tasks
3. Drag & Drop tasks
4. (stretch) Multi-user access for group projects
